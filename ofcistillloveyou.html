  <h3>Of Course I Still Love You Droneship</h3>
      <p>
        An autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) is an ocean-going vessel derived from a deck barge, outfitted with station-keeping engines and a large landing platform and is controlled by an autonomous robot. Construction of such ships was commissioned by aerospace company SpaceX to allow for recovery of rocket first-stages at sea for missions which do not carry enough fuel to return to the launch site after boosting spacecraft onto an orbital or transplanetary trajectory.

        <br><br>SpaceX has two operational drone ships, Just Read the Instructions and Of Course I Still Love You, both of which operate in the Atlantic for launches from Cape Canaveral. JRtI operated in the Pacific for Vandenberg launches from 2016 to 2019 before leaving the Port of LA in August 2019. As of 2 June 2020, 43 Falcon 9 flights have attempted to land on a drone ship, with 34 of them succeeding (78.6%).

        <br><br>The ASDS are a key early operational component in the SpaceX objective to significantly lower the price of space launch services through "full and rapid reusability," and were developed as part of the multi-year reusable rocket development program SpaceX undertook to engineer the technology. Any Falcon flights going to geostationary orbit or exceeding escape velocity require landing at sea, encompassing about half of SpaceX missions as of 2016.
